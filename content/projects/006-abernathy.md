      A previous flat roof addition of the 1930's gave the owners a family room but more could be done to graph an old addition into an even older existing structure. Gutting the addition down to the framing, rebuilding but this time turning the flat roof into a deck, giving beautiful views of the San Gabriel Mountains. Finally, matching existing handrails to the period gave an end result that lent itself perfectly into the nostalgia of the home.

      The fireplace woodwork and much of the molding you see is original. We successfully removed, restored and placed back a tremendous amount of original elements into the dining room.

      Red tile encompasses the fireplace, true to original designs from the period and vintage wallpaper completes the experience, pulling diners into the turn of the century.

      The details of the kitchen cabinetry, charming vintage style floor, light fixtures and stove build further on the farmhouse experience. While a beautifully appointed butlerâ€™s pantry provides an additional sink, utility and enough storage to make any chef or baker smile in this storied setup.
