  This Mid Century Modern, Buff & Hensman, needed to be restored back to life and yet functionally work for the family of four taking this project on. By utilizing our experience restoring historical homes and our creativity with materials, we successfully partnered in giving our clients the home they always dreamed of while honoring the home’s architectural significance.

      Conrad Buff (1926-1989) & Donald Hensman (1924-2002) created many contemporary homes throughout Southern California in the post WWII era. Celebrated for their use of design, clean lines and integration of indoor / outdoor living, Buff & Hensmen homes are a treasure of LA’s Modernism movement. As builders, we love to restore these homes, updating them into today’s standards while keeping within the original design.

      The home retains its original 1950's modern aesthetics with warm tones, period finishes, and clean lines. While custom cabinetry lends the kitchen a seamless flow that looks as if it could be original to the home.  We carefully snuck in modern touches, such as LED underlighting, to bring the home’s function up to current standards.

      A previous remodel pushed the home away from the architect's original intent. Needing immediate attention was the kitchen. The blue tile backsplash framed by the clean lines of the Quarter Sawn Oak cabinetry creates a beautiful focal point that feels both vintage and updated.

      Cork Flooring, original to the home’s design but absent from a previous remodel was replaced throughout the home in addition to new light fixtures, a great pick by the design savvy owners.
