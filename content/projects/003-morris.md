intro: |
  The American Arts & Crafts Movement has no equal to the architecture of Charles Sumner Greene (1868-1957) and brother Henry Mather Greene (1870-1954). Their designs highlight the visual importance of joints, pegs and complex wood work, done by hand, with care. Being tasked to restore one is a rare honor, as the houses are often 100 + years old and considered art. Newhaven has restored 9.

      Custom cabinetry adorns every inch of the kitchen, offering up deep, rich textures. Fantastic details reveal themselves at every angle through beveled edges, exposed joints, and the "Cloud Lift" designs the Greene Brothers were famous for.

      While our primary focus is to maintain the original character and features that make this home the work of art that it is, the owners also enjoy the benefits of modern appliances.  Crisp lines of the  large Viking range and Sub-zero fridge seamlessly blend into the surroundings.

      This home features a unique kitchen layout with an additional sink in the Butler's Pantry. There’s never a competition for sink access and the flow feels surprisingly natural in this 115 year old house.

      Just beyond the kitchen, walls of glass encompass the dining room with authentic Tiffany stained glass panels anchoring the view.  The light that pours in through these panels casts an almost magical glow that should make every meal memorable.

      Inside and out, this home exemplifies natural beauty.  As builders, we have to find and use the correct warm tones and incorporate through our finish carpentry.
