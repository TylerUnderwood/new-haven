title: 'Custom Spanish Revival'
excerpt: |
  We built this 12,000 sq/ft custom home in the style of 1920’s Spanish Revival, calling on blended Moorish and Mediterranean elements to create a distinct Santa Barbara Estate. Like many styles, Spanish Revival, done correctly, requires an exacting attention to detail throughout the construction process. The final result was a breathtaking collaboration between Newhaven and designer Lisa Pederson that led to a legacy quality, custom home.
