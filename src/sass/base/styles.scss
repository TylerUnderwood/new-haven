===== CORE STYLES =====
=
= These are for styles that will always be used. The rules here should be minimal and dry.
= When working on more specific classes and elements you don't want to have to backpedal very much, if at all.
= Don't see the need to add any more files to this folder, what is here should cover all the core needs.
